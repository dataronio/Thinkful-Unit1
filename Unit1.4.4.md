# Challenge - Evaluate an Experimental Analysis #

1. We could be having issues with an observer bias.  There should be a neutral individual doing the experimentation with slogans.  Each individual is in charge of using their favorite slogan.  Not a good experimental design.

2. Simpson's paradox -There is a hidden variable in the planets they were sent to.  Windu might have had more persuasive power but maybe his planets were smaller or biases against him.  When aggregated it appears that Binks was better.  We need to bin the planets according to a secondary attribute to see what is really going on.

3. Again Simpson's Paradox -  The HR people are concentrated on three countries.  we are binning all countries together.  We need to compare these countries separately in order to get actual meaningful differences between HR and IT departments.

4. People who install a physical fitness app are likely to already be predisposed to high activity rates.  So we have a selection bias in favor of activity.  The only questions we cound answer are in the differences in peoples choice of activities rather than just a higher level of activity.

5. Another type of selection bias.  Maybe the better students arrived in the middle of the first group and the final group of students.  So we are not really measuring the differences in the tests but simply when people came into the classroom along with the differences in abilities of those different groups of students.
