# The Experimentation RFC #

## The Problem ##

The Sith Lord organization has been having issues with recruitment.  Recruitment is important due to our never ending confict with the Jedi.  We must find new members in order to realistically oppose the Jedi.  We believe our slogan "Give in to your anger"  is old and ineffective in motivating droids to come to the dark side.  We primarily emphasize this slogan in introductory Sith meetups.  Typically these have been given by low level Sith employees in the past.

## The Potential Solution ##

Changing to a new dynamic slogan "Together we can Rule the Galaxy" will improve recuitment for the Sith Lords.

## The method of testing the solution ##

The experiment is an A/B experimental design between two slogans. For each group of new droid in our monthly recruitment intake, assign the droid randomly to either the control slogan "Give in to your anger" or the new slogan "Together we can Rule the Galaxy".  We must be careful to make sure that the droid models are distributed similarly between the control and experimental slogans.  We must make assurances that those who deliver the slogan do it in a neutral manner.  Only low level employees who have not been involved with the slogan creation will be allowed to participate in the monthly recruitment intake meetings.  They will be rotated between different slogans month to month.  The recruitment intake meeting will be monitored to minimize any chance of observer bias.

On a month by month basis we will monitor recruitment percentages.  We have a long history of recruitment percentages from these monthly meetings and can calculate recent mean and standard deviation of recruitment percentages.  

If recruitment increases by two standard deviations after a four month trial using the new slogan implement slogan immediately.  If it only increases by one standard deviation, observe for four more months and decide at that point whether to continue the trial or stop.  If in three months recruitment percentage of droids does not increase stop the trial and revert to old slogan.
