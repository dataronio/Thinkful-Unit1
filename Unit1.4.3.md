# DRILL - Am I Biased #

1. You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.
- Main issue appears to be contextual bias.  February is in Winter and many people might not respond to a bathing suit email.

2. You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.
- Selection bias - People who go to an anxiety clinic have a greater percentage chance of really being anxious.

3. You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.
- You need more than one week to get an idea of the effectiveness of the campaign.  There might be another factor that has caused the increase of website visits.  The bias might be in the placement of the billboards (area of town).

4. You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.
- Again you might need more time to gauge the effectiveness. It is not clear how this program is launched.  You might have launched the program but not communicated to the best group of customers.  You might have to target a higher income level demographic.
