# DRILL - Getting Testy #

1. Does a new supplement help people sleep better?
* Two Versions -  The control group will need a pill that is a placebo like sugar.
* Sample - We must make sure that we have supplemental information on our subjects so we know that we are randomly splitting into similar subsets.
* Hypothesis - We believe that the supplement will allow people to fall asleep faster.
* Outcome - We will need to monitor our subjects and the control group to measure the speed of falling asleep.
* Other variables -  We need to measure the length of sleep and how they feel after sleeping.

2. Will new uniforms help a gym's business? - I think this is a rather silly idea due to the difficulty of not contaminating the control group.  The only way this will work right is if there are multiple gyms.  We can then implement the new uniforms in some of the gyms picked randomly.

3. Will a new homepage improve my online exotic pet rental business?
* Two Versions - We need to allocate to the new homepage versus the old homepage as control.
* Sample - We need to make use of supplemental information on our customers so we are splitting randomly.
* Hypothesis - We can improve sales by using the new homepage.
* Outcome - Measure supplemental info such as page views and length of session as additional info that our new homepage might improve.
* Other variables - Use the demographic info of our current customers to allocate randomly.

4. If I put 'please read' in the email subject will more people read my emails?
* Two Versions - Self explanatory
* Sample - Do you know anything useful to split amoung the groups you email?  Otherwise just implement randomly the 'please read' subject.
* Hypothesis - You will need to implement an email read receipt so you can measure who is reading the emails.  We believe that more people will respond if you have the new header.
* Outcome - Improvement in response as measured by receiving back a read receipt email.
* Other Variables - Are you selling something?  You can measure if responses lead to sales improvements as supplemental info. Use any demographics of the email recipients to improve allocation into groups.
